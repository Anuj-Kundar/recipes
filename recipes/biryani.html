        Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful Indian rice dish prepared with a
        blend of aromatic spices, meat (or vegetables), and long-grain Basmati
        rice.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Biryani is a cherished culinary masterpiece that originated in the
        Indian subcontinent but has since become popular worldwide. This
        exquisite dish comes in various regional variations, each boasting its
        own unique blend of flavors and ingredients. The heart of any biryani
        lies in the preparation of perfectly spiced meat, such as tender pieces
        of chicken, succulent mutton, or flavorful shrimp, often marinated in
        yogurt and a blend of spices to infuse it with depth and richness. In a
        separate pot, fragrant long-grain Basmati rice is partially cooked,
        seasoned with whole spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves, which
        lend their captivating aroma to the dish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partially cooked rice and marinated meat are then layered in a large
        pot, along with fried onions, mint, and saffron-infused milk, creating
        intricate layers of flavor. The pot is then sealed with a lid or dough
        to trap the steam, allowing the rice and meat to cook together,
        exchanging their essences and merging into a heavenly symphony of taste
        and aroma. The result is a mouthwatering and visually stunning biryani,
        served with raita, a cooling yogurt-based accompaniment, which adds a
        perfect contrast to the rich and aromatic rice dish. Biryani's ability
        to bring together the finest spices, tender meat, and fragrant rice is a
        testament to the culinary artistry and heritage of the Indian
        subcontinent.

        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot
            oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper
            towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions,
            garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and
            golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and
            turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and
            cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked
            to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture
            becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat
            until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a
            little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If
            necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for
            at least 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden.
            Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and
            saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and
            stir well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a
            boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam
            for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.
          </li>
          <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
