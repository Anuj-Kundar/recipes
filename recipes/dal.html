      Dal Makhani is a rich and creamy North Indian dish made from black lentils
      and kidney beans cooked in a tomato-based sauce, often flavored with
      butter and cream.

    <p>
      Dal Makhani is a beloved vegetarian delicacy that hails from the Punjab
      region of India. To prepare this indulgent dish, black lentils (urad dal)
      and kidney beans (rajma) are soaked overnight, then cooked until tender
      and creamy. In a separate pan, a delightful combination of onions,
      tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and a medley of spices like cumin, coriander,
      and garam masala are sautéed until fragrant
    </p>
    <p>
      The cooked lentils and beans are then added to the spiced mixture, and the
      dish is simmered on low heat for an extended period, allowing the flavors
      to meld together. Traditionally, a generous amount of butter and cream is
      stirred in to give the dish its signature richness and velvety
      texture.Served hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice, Dal Makhani is a true
      celebration of hearty, comforting flavors that have won the hearts of food
      enthusiasts worldwide.
